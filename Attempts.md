# DeepLab
DeepLab was the first choice, as we wanted to do a Object Segmentation Program but ran into several issues. 
We were stuck in a loop due SciPy wanting a NumPy version newer than 1.25, but TensorFlow wanting one older than 1.25.
SciPy and TensorFlow were using different NumPy syntaxes, and eventually found out after trial and error.

Troubleshooting:
  - Installing NumPy 1.26.4
  - Installing Numpy 1.24.4
  - Migrating Older Syntaxes
  - Reinstallation of Model

After Troubleshooting and attempting to properly install the model to the Jetson we decided to contiue with object segmentation,
but instead use a different model.
